# Rust Hello World

## Description
Simple Hello World project in Rust

## New project with Cargo

```console
$ cargo new hello-world
    Creating binary (application) `hello-world` package
note: see more `Cargo.toml` keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
```

## Running the application
The `cargo new` step generated a "Hello, world!" project for us! 
We can run this program by moving into the new directory that we made and running this in our terminal:

```console
cargo run
   Compiling hello-world v0.1.0 (.../Hello World/hello-world)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.15s
     Running `target/debug/hello-world`
Hello, world!
```
